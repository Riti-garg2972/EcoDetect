## ðŸ“Š Problem

We have addressed two different types of problems:
Waste management is a critical aspect of environmental sustainability. With the increasing amount of global waste, classifying waste materials into different categories is critical for effective waste management, resource conservation, and environmental protection.
2. Secondly, Plant Disease Detection - Is critical for ensuring food security and sustainable agriculture. By detecting plant diseases early, farmers can take appropriate actions to manage and prevent the spread of diseases, reducing crop losses and promoting sustainable farming practices.

## Solution

One strategy for waste management is the classification of waste materials into different categories like metal, plastic, glass, and compost. The classification of these materials is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it facilitates recycling efforts by enabling efficient sorting and processing of waste materials. Recycling materials like metal and glass conserves natural resources and reduces the need for new raw materials. Proper disposal of waste materials can also reduce their environmental impact. For example, plastic waste can take hundreds of years to decompose and can harm wildlife and ecosystems.

Our plant disease detection service provides a wide range of services to users, making it an essential tool for farmers, gardeners, and anyone interested in plant health. One of the most significant benefits of these apps is disease identification. Users can upload images of their plants or crops to the web app and receive an identification of the disease affecting their plants. This feature can help users identify diseases early on and take appropriate actions to manage and prevent their spread.
